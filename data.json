There is also a 4' and 8' cleanout along the wall near Broad street, but when checking it today neither have a drop of water in them, yet the parking lot manhole is covered with water and water is still ponding from last Saturday night's rain.  \r\n\r\nWithout fully understanding the circumstances of the various drain pipes, it appears that maybe there's some downline damage to the City main or another pipe under Broad street.                Candidly, we fear this is going to create long term issues for our storm system, our guests and employees vehicles, etc\u2026 The rain Saturday morning through Sunday early morning had our lot full of standing water and you can imagine how close it was to flooding vehicles if we didn't have it blocked off.
