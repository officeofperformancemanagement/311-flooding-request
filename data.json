Takes 2.5+ days for it to drain after any size rain event. Larger takes longer. I reached out directly to DRC and they recommended to note that the area is in the combined sewer. I believe this will be handled by waste water since I told them that the line was clear all the way to the street.                                               To reiterate what o shared with the DRC team: We have had some storm drainage issues related to the low point of our parcel that appears to flow to the city main under Broad street. There is also a 4' and 8' cleanout along the wall near Broad street, but when checking it today neither have a drop of water in them, yet the parking lot manhole is covered with water and water is still ponding from last Saturday night's rain.  \r\n\r\nWithout fully understanding the circumstances of the various drain pipes, it appears that maybe there's some downline damage to the City main or another pipe under Broad street.                Candidly, we fear this is going to create long term issues for our storm system, our guests and employees vehicles, etc\u2026 The rain Saturday morning through Sunday early morning had our lot full of standing water and you can imagine how close it was to flooding vehicles if we didn't have it blocked off. We intend to have daily public parking and monthly parking vehicles for downtowners.

The water level in the drain at 5:32 pm has risen to  30 inches below my building.  The storm drain runs under the building and parallel with Brainerd Rd.  In heavy rains for a short period, the storm drain rises under the building and if backs up, floods the building.  It will also flood the Chattanooga Kidney Center next door.  My request is to make sure that there is not debris clogging the storm drain downstream from my building.  I know it was cleaned out within the last year.  With the Flood Warning in effect I would appreciate any preventative measures if there is still time, which there may not be time.  thanks, James Rogers, owner and operator of PPS Orthotic & Prosthetic Services, 3700 Brainerd Rd.","status":"completed","address":"3700 Brainerd Rd, Chattanooga, 37411","location":"Chattanooga","zipcode":null,"date_created":1739399774,"count_comments":2,"count_followers":4,"count_supporters":4,"lat":35.022833123,"lon":-85.243420709,"user_follows":0,"user_comments":0,"user_request":0,"rank":"1","user":""}}],"count":"30","benchmark":1.102092981338501,"status":{"type":"success","message":"Success","code":200,"code_message":"Ok"}}}
